 OptiSystem 10: A Powerful Tool for Optical Communication System Design     
Optical communication systems are essential for transmitting large amounts of data over long distances, such as in the Internet, 5G networks, LiDAR, sensors, quantum key distribution (QKD), free-space optics (FSO), and other applications. However, designing and optimizing such systems can be challenging, as they involve complex physical phenomena, nonlinear effects, noise sources, modulation formats, and network architectures. To address these challenges, Optiwave Systems Inc. offers OptiSystem, a comprehensive software design suite that enables users to plan, test, and simulate optical links in the transmission layer of modern optical networks.
     
OptiSystem 10 is the latest version of OptiSystem, available in 32-bit and TRUE 64-bit editions. It features a number of new enhancements to address co-simulation with Mathworks Matlab and Simulink. Co-simulation allows users to integrate custom Matlab scripts and Simulink models into OptiSystem projects, enabling them to leverage the powerful mathematical and graphical capabilities of Matlab and Simulink for optical system design. Users can also export OptiSystem data to Matlab and Simulink for further analysis and visualization. Co-simulation can be useful for implementing advanced signal processing algorithms, custom components, or user-defined functions that are not available in OptiSystem's extensive component library.

OptiSystem 10 also introduces OptiPerformer, a freeware complement to OptiSystem. OptiPerformer empowers research colleagues, sales and marketing teams, and students with a full working freeware simulation environment enabling them to load existing OptiSystem files, run full simulations, and view results. OptiPerformer can be used for demonstration purposes, educational activities, or collaborative projects without requiring a full OptiSystem license. OptiPerformer supports all types of optical networks, such as access network (AN), storage area network (SAN), metropolitan area network (MAN), etc.
     
OptiSystem 10 is compatible with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 operating systems. Users can download a free trial version of OptiSystem 10 from the official website of Optiwave Systems Inc.. Users can also find tutorials, webinars, technical papers, and user guides on the website to learn more about OptiSystem's features and applications. For users who want to upgrade to the latest version of OptiSystem, Optiwave Systems Inc. has recently released OptiSystem 20.0, which offers more enhancements and improvements for optical system design. Users can contact Optiwave Systems Inc. for pricing and licensing information.
